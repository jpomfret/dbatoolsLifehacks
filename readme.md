# dbatools lifehack workspace

This is a repo containing a dev container for my dbatools lifehacks demo.

## Demos


## Rebuild the containers
In order to rebuild the environment fully, you need to run the following from a seperate window

`docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" -p "dbatoolslifehacks_devcontainer" down`
